# Polymorphism and Overloading in C++

## AIM
To explore **Polymorphism in C++** with a focus on **Overloading concepts**, including:
- Constructor Overloading
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading

---

## Introduction to Overloading in C++
In C++, **overloading** allows you to define multiple functions, constructors, or operators with the **same name** but different parameter lists or behaviors.  

### Purpose of Overloading
- Enhances **readability**  
- Provides **flexibility**  
- Improves **reusability of code**  

The compiler determines which version to execute based on the number or type of arguments provided.

---

## Theory
- **Polymorphism in C++** enables a single name to take on multiple forms.  
- **Overloading** is a type of **compile-time polymorphism**, where functions, constructors, or operators behave differently depending on the inputs they receive.

## Constructor Overloading

### Definition
Constructor overloading allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

### Purpose
- Provides flexibility in object creation.  
- Enables objects to be initialized in different ways depending on the arguments passed.  

### Key Points
- All constructors share the same name as the class.  
- Distinguished by their parameter lists (number or type of parameters).  
- Enhances flexibility and readability.
